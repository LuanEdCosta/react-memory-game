# :flower_playing_cards:  React Memory Game

This is a memory game created with React, TypeScript and Styled Components.

## :heart: Motivation

I want to learn TypeScript to understand more about the types used in public libraries and frameworks such as React, React Native and Axios. I also want to create my own libraries to contribute with the awesome JavaScript community.

A lot of companies are using TypeScript to build large and scalable projects, because it improves the intellisense, the documentation and prevent errors when the customers are using the software.

I strongly believe that TypeScipt is something that I need to learn in order to became a better software developer.
